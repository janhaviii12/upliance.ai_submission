- You will work with three datasets: UserDetails, CookingSessions, and OrderDetails.
- The task involves cleaning and merging the data, analyzing the relationship between cooking sessions and user orders, identifying popular dishes, and exploring demographic factors that influence user behavior.
- Additionally, you will create visualizations to showcase key insights and write a report summarizing your findings and business recommendations.
